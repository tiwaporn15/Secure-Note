# SecureNote — Conceptual Report

**Subject:** Web Development Fundamentals & Architecture  
**Assignment:** Full-Stack "SecureNote" Application  
**Frontend Path:** B — React.js + Vite

---

## 1. JS Engine vs. Runtime

### Two separate JavaScript environments

SecureNote runs JavaScript in **two entirely different environments**, which is the core of this assignment's architecture.

#### Frontend: Browser Runtime
`frontend/src/**/*.jsx` files are bundled by Vite and executed inside the **browser**. The JavaScript *engine* is **V8** (Chrome/Edge) or **SpiderMonkey** (Firefox). The browser *runtime* wraps the engine and provides exclusive browser APIs:

- `document`, `window` — DOM and browser-object model
- `fetch()` — Fetch API for HTTP requests
- `addEventListener` — event handling
- `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` — client-side storage
- `ReactDOM.createRoot()` — React mounts into the real DOM

**None of these exist in Node.js.**

#### Backend: Node.js Runtime
`backend/server.js` runs on the **server machine** under the **Node.js runtime**. It also uses the V8 engine, but Node provides completely different APIs:

- `process.env` — access to environment variables (OS-level)
- `require()` / CommonJS modules
- `fs`, `path`, `net` — file system, networking, OS modules
- `http` / `express` — HTTP server creation
- `Buffer` — binary data handling

**There is no `document` in Node.js.** There is no `process.env` in the browser.

> **Key insight:** V8 is the engine in both environments. The *runtime* wrapping it determines what APIs are available. `process.env.SECRET_TOKEN` works in `server.js` but would throw `ReferenceError: process is not defined` in any browser-executed file.

## 2. DOM — How the Frontend Updates the Screen (React / Virtual DOM)

SecureNote uses **React.js** (Path B), which means the Virtual DOM manages real-DOM updates rather than manual manipulation.

### What is the Virtual DOM?

React maintains an **in-memory JavaScript object tree** (the Virtual DOM) that mirrors the real browser DOM. When state changes, React:

1. Re-renders the affected component functions, producing a new Virtual DOM tree.
2. **Diffs** the new tree against the previous one (reconciliation).
3. Computes the **minimal set of real DOM changes** needed.
4. Applies only those changes to the browser's real DOM (commit phase).

This is more efficient than manually removing/appending every element.

### How state changes drive UI updates in this project

```jsx
// In NotesPage.jsx
const [notes, setNotes] = useState([])   // React state

// When a new note is created:
setNotes(prev => [newNote, ...prev])
// React diffs → sees one new <NoteCard> at the top → inserts one real <article> element
```

```jsx
// In App.jsx
const [token, setToken] = useState(null)

// When user logs in:
onLogin(token)  →  setToken(token)
// React diffs → LoginPage unmounts, NotesPage mounts — entire page swaps, no navigation
```

### useEffect for data fetching

```jsx
useEffect(() => { loadNotes() }, [])
// Runs once after component mounts (equivalent to DOMContentLoaded in vanilla JS)
// Fetches data → setNotes() → React re-renders the grid
```

**Component mapping** replaces a `for` loop of `createElement`:
```jsx
{notes.map((note, idx) => (
  <NoteCard key={note.id} note={note} animDelay={idx * 50} />
))}
// React maps data → Virtual DOM nodes → efficiently inserts real DOM elements
```

## 3. HTTP/HTTPS — The Request/Response Cycle

### What happens when the user clicks "Save Note"

1. `ComposePanel.jsx` calls `onSave(title, content)` which triggers in `NotesPage.jsx`:

```js
const res = await fetch('/api/notes', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type':  'application/json',
    'Authorization': token,        // SECRET_TOKEN in header, never in source
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ title, content }),
})
```

2. Vite's dev proxy forwards `/api/*` → `http://localhost:3001/api/*` (configured in `vite.config.js`). This avoids CORS issues during development.

3. The browser constructs an **HTTP/1.1 POST request**:
```
POST /api/notes HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3001
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: SecureNote-S3cr3t-K3y-2025

{"title":"My Note","content":"Hello world"}
```

4. Express parses the request. The `requireAuth` middleware reads the `Authorization` header and compares it to `process.env.SECRET_TOKEN`.

5. If valid, Express sends a second HTTP request to **PocketHost** with the `POCKETHOST_TOKEN` in a `Bearer` Authorization header.

6. PocketHost responds `201 Created` → Express responds `201 Created` → React calls `setNotes(prev => [newNote, ...prev])` → card appears instantly.

### HTTP Verbs and Status Codes

| Verb   | Endpoint           | Auth Required | Description          |
|--------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| GET    | `/api/notes`       | No            | Read all notes       |
| POST   | `/api/notes`       | Yes           | Create a new note    |
| DELETE | `/api/notes/:id`   | Yes           | Delete a note by ID  |

| Status | Meaning       | When returned                       |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| 200    | OK            | Successful GET or DELETE            |
| 201    | Created       | Successful POST                     |
| 400    | Bad Request   | Missing title or content            |
| 401    | Unauthorized  | Wrong or missing Authorization      |
| 404    | Not Found     | DELETE with non-existent ID         |
| 500    | Server Error  | Unexpected server exception         |

### Why HTTPS is critical in production

We use **HTTP locally** (unencrypted). In production, HTTPS adds **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**:

- **Encryption:** All data — including the `Authorization` header containing `SECRET_TOKEN` — is encrypted between client and server. Without HTTPS, anyone on the same network can read the token in plain text using a packet sniffer.
- **Integrity:** TLS message authentication codes (MACs) prevent tampering mid-transit.
- **Authentication:** TLS certificates (signed by Certificate Authorities) verify the server's identity, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

Even a "simple" internal tool like SecureNote needs HTTPS in production because leaking the token means anyone can create or delete notes impersonating an authorized user.

## 4. Environment Variables — Why SECRET_TOKEN Lives on the Backend

### The golden rule: secrets never touch the client

`SECRET_TOKEN` and `POCKETHOST_TOKEN` live exclusively in `backend/.env`:

```dotenv
SECRET_TOKEN=SecureNote-S3cr3t-K3y-2025
POCKETHOST_TOKEN=20260301eink
```

Loaded into `process.env` by `dotenv` at **server startup**. They are never written into any file the browser downloads.

### What would happen if we put SECRET_TOKEN in React code?

```jsx
// App.jsx — CATASTROPHICALLY WRONG
const SECRET_TOKEN = 'SecureNote-S3cr3t-K3y-2025'
```

Vite **bundles all source files into JavaScript sent to every browser**. Any visitor can:
1. Open DevTools → Network → view any JS bundle
2. Search for the token string
3. Make unlimited authenticated POST/DELETE requests, bypassing all access control

**There is no such thing as a secret in frontend code.** The browser must download it to run it.

### How environment variables keep secrets safe

| Property                | Backend `.env`        | Frontend JSX source |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Visible to visitors?    | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes (DevTools)   |
| Committed to Git?       | ❌ No (.gitignore)    | ✅ Yes              |
| Exists only in memory?  | ✅ Yes (process.env)  | ❌ N/A              |
| Safe for secrets?       | ✅ Yes                | ❌ Never            |

The `.gitignore` ensures `.env` never enters the repository. If a secret appears in Git history — even once, even deleted — it is compromised and must be rotated.

## Bonus Features

### +15 pts: PocketHost Data Persistence

Notes are stored in a hosted PocketBase instance via the backend proxy. Notes survive server restarts. The architecture:

```
Browser → POST /api/notes (Authorization: SECRET_TOKEN)
       → Express validates → proxies to PocketHost (Bearer: POCKETHOST_TOKEN)
       → PocketHost stores record → returns new note
       → Express returns 201 → React updates state
```

The frontend never knows PocketHost exists. The `POCKETHOST_TOKEN` is only ever in `process.env`.

### +5 pts: Loading State

- **Skeleton cards** shimmer during initial `fetchNotes()` via `@keyframes shimmer`
- **Inline spinner** on the Save button during POST requests
- **Optimistic delete** with inline confirm dialog before the request fires
- All loading states managed via React `useState` (`loading`, `deleting`)
